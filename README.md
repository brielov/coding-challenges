# Coding Challenges

This repo contains a set of coding challenges you can pick from with their corresponding test files. The idea is that given an empty implementation and its corresponding test file, the interviewed can be assured that his/her implementation is spot on.

## Available challenges

### Linked List (single)

This challenges expectes the interviewed to implement a few methods of the linked-list data structure. If tests pass, then you're good to go.

```
npm run test:linked-list
```
